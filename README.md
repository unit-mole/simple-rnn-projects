- a clearly defined business or analytical problem;
- reproducible data preparation and sequence generation;
- leakage-aware training, validation, and test design;
- a trainable Keras `SimpleRNN` as the primary model;
- task-appropriate baseline comparison and evaluation;
- saved model and preprocessing artifacts;
- reusable inference code;
- an interactive Streamlit demonstration;
- automated tests and project-specific GitHub Actions CI;
- local-run and deployment guidance; and
- an honest discussion of assumptions, limitations, and future improvements.

The portfolio is designed to demonstrate skills relevant to Data Science, Machine Learning, Applied AI, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Quality Analytics, and Analytics Engineering roles.

## What the Portfolio Covers

The six projects are intentionally varied so the repository demonstrates more than one type of recurrent-neural-network problem.

### Time-Series Forecasting

- **Electricity Consumption Forecasting** predicts future electricity demand from recent hourly consumption and calendar patterns.
- **Google Stock Price Prediction** estimates next-session closing price from recent daily return sequences.

These projects demonstrate chronological splitting, leakage prevention, sequence-window creation, scaling, regression evaluation, baseline comparison, residual analysis, and recursive or next-step forecasting.

### Natural Language Processing and Text Classification

- **IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis** converts unstructured movie-review text into positive or negative sentiment predictions.
- **SMS Spam Detection** will classify messages as spam or legitimate.
- **Text Generation** will model character- or word-level sequence continuation.
- **Word Embedding** will explore learned semantic representations and similarity.

These projects demonstrate text cleaning, tokenization, vocabulary control, embeddings, sequence padding, recurrent text modeling, classification metrics, probability interpretation, and error analysis.

### Representation Learning and Sequential Modeling

Across the portfolio, Simple RNN models learn representations from ordered observations rather than treating each row or token independently.

The completed projects cover:

- numeric time-series sequences;
- financial-return sequences;
- tokenized natural-language sequences;
- regression and binary classification;
- one-step and multi-step forecasting;
- probability-based sentiment scoring; and
- comparison with strong non-neural baselines.

## What the Repository Demonstrates

### End-to-End Machine Learning Delivery

Every completed project is structured to move beyond notebook-only experimentation. The repository demonstrates:

- business-problem definition;
- reproducible data preparation;
- sequence and feature engineering;
- training, validation, and test separation;
- model evaluation;
- saved preprocessing and model artifacts;
- reusable prediction pipelines;
- manual and batch inference;
- downloadable outputs;
- local execution; and
- cloud deployment.

### Sequence Modeling with Correct Validation

Sequential data requires more care than randomly shuffled tabular data. The repository emphasizes:

- chronological splitting for forecasting projects;
- review-level splitting for text classification;
- training-only preprocessing;
- consistent sequence generation during training and inference;
- validation-based hyperparameter or threshold selection;
- untouched final test evaluation; and
- explicit documentation of leakage risks.

### Model Evaluation Based on the Actual Problem

The projects use metrics that match the task rather than relying on one headline score.

Examples include:

- MAE, RMSE, MAPE, sMAPE, R², and residual analysis for forecasting;
- precision, recall, F1, specificity, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and MCC for classification;
- directional accuracy for financial forecasting;
- confusion matrices and probability distributions;
- threshold analysis for sentiment classification; and
- baseline comparisons to determine whether the Simple RNN adds measurable value.

### Reliable and Reusable Engineering

The repository includes practices required for dependable inference:

- modular source files instead of notebook-only logic;
- saved scalers, tokenizers, metadata, and Keras models;
- consistent feature or token order between training and prediction;
- safe handling of missing values, unknown tokens, and invalid uploads;
- automated tests for important preprocessing and prediction paths;
- project-specific GitHub Actions workflows;
- Streamlit deployment from the repository’s `main` branch; and
- GitHub-safe data and artifact management.

### Business and Analytical Translation

The applications do not stop at raw model outputs. Depending on the project, they provide:

- future-demand forecasts;
- next-session price estimates;
- predicted sentiment;
- probabilities and confidence levels;
- model and baseline comparisons;
- error interpretations;
- batch summaries; and
- downloadable scored datasets.

This demonstrates the ability to convert technical model outputs into information that can be understood by analysts, engineers, managers, and other business stakeholders.

### Responsible Model Communication

Each project clearly documents its intended scope and limitations. The repository avoids presenting portfolio models as production-ready financial, operational, or human-decision systems without additional validation, governance, and monitoring.

## Repository Convention

The repository is organized as a monorepo. Each completed project generally follows this structure:

```text
simple-rnn-projects/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── project-specific-ci.yml
│
├── project-folder/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── streamlit_app.py
│   │   └── requirements.txt
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── sample_input.csv
│   │   └── README_data.md
│   ├── images/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   ├── outputs/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── .gitignore
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── README_HOSTING.md
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── supporting project files
│
├── LICENSE
├── PROJECT_ROADMAP.md
└── README.md
```

The exact files vary by project, but the standards remain consistent:

- reproducible workflows;
- modular code;
- deployable inference;
- automated validation;
- clear documentation;
- safe repository practices; and
- transparent model limitations.
